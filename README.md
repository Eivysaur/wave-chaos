# wave-chaos

A program developed to do high performance parallel computations of the wavefunction and scattering matrix statistics in various geometries. A quantum wavefunction is an analogue to the electric field in two-dimensional systems with cylindrical symmetry. The S matrix statistics are used to evaluate the scattering dynamics.
